# Twitch-Lang-Greeting-Bot

This Twitch bot sends greetings in different languages to the Twitch channel it joins. It is built with Python, using the `irc.bot` library to establish communication with the Twitch server.

## How It Works

The bot uses a dictionary of translated greetings, where each key-value pair consists of a language and the corresponding translation of "Hello, friend". Upon joining the Twitch channel, the bot starts sending these greetings, one by one, with a delay of 10 seconds between each message. Once it goes through all the greetings, it starts over from the beginning.

## Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to replace the placeholders for `NICKNAME`, `TOKEN`, and `CHANNEL` with your bot's Twitch username, OAuth token, and the Twitch channel name you want the bot to join, respectively.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, you simply need to run the main Python script. It has a built-in logging mechanism that logs important events like connecting to the server, joining a channel, sending a message, etc.

Please note that this bot is a simple demonstration of how to create a Twitch bot using Python and the `irc.bot` library. It doesn't handle all possible IRC events or errors that might occur during a real-world usage. 

Refer to the `irc.bot` library documentation for more details on how to handle other events and improve the bot.
